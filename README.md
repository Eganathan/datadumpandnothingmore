# Dynamic Data for my website
This is just a dump of json-values that are used by websites to show dynamic content, this helps me update the values without loggining into the webhost or editing the html etc, by using this dump i can easily modify the values directly from my terminal :)

- projects.js is used by [Projects](https://projects.eknath.dev)
